      <p class="paragraph1">NYC is a metropolis characterized by its diverse <br>
        and dynamic nature, and data analysis is crucial <br>
        for understanding its inner workings. The Bureau <br>
        of Fire Investigation provides detailed information <br>
        on fire incidents, causes, and trends over time. <br><br>

        Ranging from 2016–2020, and found on the NYC Open <br>
        Data website (data.cityofnewyork.us), this information <br>
        is valuable for researchers and policymakers seeking to <br>
        comprehend factors contributing to fires, identify high-<br>
        risk areas, and develop effective preventive strategies— <br>
        or for anyone looking for insight on these devastating <br>
        events. This dataset is an essential tool for comprehending <br>
        diverse facets of life in NYC and enhancing safety measures.

        The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in reported fires in New York City in 2020 compared to the previous four years. According to the Bureau of Fire Investigation, only 2,979 fires were reported, a decrease of almost 90% from the average number of 29,540 fires reported between the period of 2016 and 2019. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including the closure of public spaces and the reduced capacity of commercial establishments. These closures meant that there were fewer opportunities for fires to start, and this also translated to fewer incidents of arson. Additionally, with many buildings vacant or underutilized, there were fewer risks of fires caused by heating or electrical equipment malfunctions.

      <div class="paragraph3">
        The pandemic also brought greater awareness of fire safety among individuals spending more time at home, as more people worked from home. This may have contributed to the reduction in fires caused by common errors such as leaving cooking unattended or ignoring smoke detectors' functionality—and less heaters and appliances left unaccounted for. However, it is important to acknowledge that, as with everything, neighborhoods of color with older buildings, inadequate and unreliable fire safety resources, and higher poverty rates may still have experienced higher fires compared to gentrified neighborhoods, and despite the decrease it is important to remain vigilant about fire safety—especially in communities that may be at higher risk.
