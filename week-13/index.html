      <p class="paragraph1">NYC is a metropolis characterized by its diverse <br>
        and dynamic nature, and data analysis is crucial <br>
        for understanding its inner workings. The Bureau <br>
        of Fire Investigation provides detailed information <br>
        on fire incidents, causes, and trends over time. <br><br>

        Ranging from 2016–2020, and found on the NYC Open <br>
        Data website (data.cityofnewyork.us), this information <br>
        is valuable for researchers and policymakers seeking to <br>
        comprehend factors contributing to fires, identify high-<br>
        risk areas, and develop effective preventive strategies— <br>
        or for anyone looking for insight on these devastating <br>
        events. This dataset is an essential tool for comprehending <br>

      <div class="paragraph2">
        The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in reported fires in New York City in 2020 compared to the previous four years. According to the Bureau of Fire Investigation, only 2,979 fires were reported, a decrease of almost 90% from the average number of 29,540 fires reported between the period of 2016 and 2019. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including the closure of public spaces and the reduced capacity of commercial establishments. These closures meant that there were fewer opportunities for fires to start, and this also translated to fewer incidents of arson. Additionally, with many buildings vacant or underutilized, there were fewer risks of fires caused by heating or electrical equipment malfunctions.
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph3">
        The pandemic also brought greater awareness of fire safety among individuals spending more time at home, as more people worked from home. This may have contributed to the reduction in fires caused by common errors such as leaving cooking unattended or ignoring smoke detectors' functionality—and less heaters and appliances left unaccounted for. However, it is important to acknowledge that, as with everything, neighborhoods of color with older buildings, inadequate and unreliable fire safety resources, and higher poverty rates may still have experienced higher fires compared to gentrified neighborhoods, and despite the decrease it is important to remain vigilant about fire safety—especially in communities that may be at higher risk.

<img class="title3" id="faq" src="https://i.postimg.cc/Twvhptts/FAQ-2.png" alt="Frequently Asked Questions">



<hr class="line1">

  <p class="question1">1. Is there a notable difference between white <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color? How is this<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; impactful?
  </p>
  
  <p class="answer1"> 
    In short: Yes. The leading fire causes in neighborhoods of color in NYC are similar to those in white neighborhoods, including cooking, electrical issues, heating equipment malfunctions, and smoking; however, these causes are more prominent in neighborhoods of color due to factors such as older and poorly-maintained buildings, inadequate access to fire safety resources and education, higher rates of poverty, and associated challenges like overcrowding and lack of working smoke detectors. For example, in the South Bronx, which has a high poverty rate and many old buildings, cooking-related fires are a common cause, as are fires related to heating equipment malfunctions and electrical issues, and even though it comes in third place, we must remember that Queens is twice as big, so in relation to their scale, the Bronx has double the fire activity.
    <br><br>According to the Bureau of Fire Investigation, there were 578 fires in Manhattan and 667 fires in Queens from March 23, 2020, to December 31, 2020. In comparison, there were 938 fires in Brooklyn and 630 fires in the Bronx during this period. These numbers suggest that communities in Brooklyn and the Bronx (predominantly of color) experienced a higher number of fires than predominantly White neighborhoods in Manhattan and Queens.

<hr class="line2">

  <p class="question2"> 2. Did more electrical and heater fires happen because people <br> 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; were forced to stay home?

  </p>

  <p class="answer2"> 
    According to NYC Open Data for the Bureau of Fire Investigation,  quite the contrary! There were 217 electrical fires and 177 heater fires from March 23, 2020, to December 31, 2020, in New York City—and while these numbers may seem high, they actually represent a decrease in the overall number of fires during this period. Experts speculate that this decrease may be due in part to the fact that more people were staying home during the pandemic and therefore were more aware of potential fire hazards. Additionally, increased use of technology for work and entertainment may have decreased the need for heating appliances and reduced the likelihood of electrical fires, as did tending to cooking and appliances with more supervision.  </p>

<hr class="line3">

  <p class="question3">3. What is the drop/rise of fires just before lockdown and <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;during this period?
  </p>

  <p class="answer3"> 
    According to data from the NYC Open Data for the Bureau of Fire Investigation, the number of fires in New York City decreased significantly during the period of lockdown from March 23, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The number of fires during this period was 2,979, a sharp decrease from the same period in previous years, which had an average of 32,519 fires. While there is no specific data on the drop/rise of fires just before and during lockdown, the overall decrease in fires during this period may be attributed to factors such as decreased human activity and more people staying at home.  
  </p>

<hr class="line4">

  <p class="question4">4. Where were these fires happening?
  </p>

  <p class="answer4"> 
    Residential buildings were the most frequently reported location for fires during this period, with a total of 1,544 reported fires, accounting for 54% of all reported fires. This is not surprising, given the high density of population in residential buildings, which have multiple fire hazards—cooking appliances, heating systems, electrical outlets, etc. Following behind were non-residential buildings, which had 605 reported fires during the same period, accounting for 23% of all reported fires. This category includes commercial buildings, warehouses, and industrial facilities. Outdoor areas, including parks and other public spaces, had a total of 257 reported fires, representing 12% of fires, while vehicles had 206 reported fires, accounting for 8%. The smallest proportion of fires was reported in other structures, such as storage sheds and garages, with a total of 84 reported fires, representing 3% of all reported fires.
    <br><br>These findings emphasize the need for continued efforts in fire prevention education and building safety regulations in both residential and non-residential buildings, outdoor areas, and vehicles. By addressing common fire hazards and promoting safe practices, the number of fires and their associated risks can be minimized in these locations.</p>
