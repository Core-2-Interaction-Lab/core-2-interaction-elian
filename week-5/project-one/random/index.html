              9.	
              
                    I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words,
                    gardens, streams, or the West wind. Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar 
                    trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came 
                    from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was 
                    a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. But from the end of the avenue, 
                    from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a 
                    paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. 

                    He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 
                    
                    "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
                    
                    Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
                    
                    "The garden?" 
                    
                    "The garden of forking paths." 
                    
                    Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
                    
                    "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 
                    
                    "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

                  In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. 
                  He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly 
                  risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous 
                  country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - 
                  a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.

                  From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the 
                  first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that 
                  so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train 
                  schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring 
                  this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me. I foresee that man will resign himself each 
                  day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some 
                  atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past. Thus 
                  I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and 
                  watched the diffuse coming of night. The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a 
                  field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.

                                            mythical labyrinth. I imagined it                     infinite, made not only of eight-sided 
                                          untouched and perfect on the secret                     pavilions and of twisting paths but

                                        I thought of a maze of mazes, of a                                                                       my destiny - that of the hunted.

                  In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. 
                  He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly 
                  risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous 
                  country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - 
                  a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.
