              9.	
              
                    I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words,
                    gardens, streams, or the West wind. Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar 
                    trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came 
                    from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was 
                    a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. But from the end of the avenue, 
                    from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a 
                    paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. 

                    He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 
                    
                    "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
                    
                    Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
                    
                    "The garden?" 
                    
                    "The garden of forking paths." 
                    
                    Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
                    
                    "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 
                    
                    "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

                  In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. 
                  He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly 
                  risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous 
                  country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - 
                  a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.

                  From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the 
                  first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. I argued that 
                  so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train 
                  schedule, I would be in prison or dead. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring 
                  this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me. I foresee that man will resign himself each 
                  day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some 
                  atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past. Thus 
                  I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and 
                  watched the diffuse coming of night. The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a 
                  field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.

  Antes de exhumar esta carta, yo me había preguntado 
  de qué manera un libro puede ser infinito. No conjeturé 
  otro procedimiento que el de un volumen cíclico, 
  circular. Un volumen cuya última página fuera idéntica 
  a la primera, con posibilidad de continuar indefinidamente. 
  Recordé también esa noche que está en el centro de 
  Las 1001 Noches, cuando la reina Shahrazad (por una 
  mágica distracción del copista) se pone a referir 
  textualmente la historia de Las 1001 Noches, con 
  riesgo de llegar otra vez a la noche en que la refiere, 
  y así hasta lo infinito. Imaginé también una obra 
  platónica, hereditaria, transmitida de padre a hijo, 
  en la que cada nuevo individuo agregara un capítulo o 
  corrigiera con piadoso cuidado la página de sus mayores. 
  Esas conjeturas me distrajeron; pero ninguna me parecía 
  corresponder, siquiera de un modo remoto, a los 
  contradictorios capítulos de Ts'ui Pên. En esa 
  perplejidad, me remitieron de Oxford el manuscrito 
  que usted ha examinado. Me detuve, como es natural, 
  en la frase: Dejo a los varios porvenires (no a todos) 
  mi jardín de senderos que se bifurcan. Casi en el acto 
  comprendí; el jardín de los senderos que se bifurcan 
  era la novela caótica; la frase varios porvenires 
  (no a todos) me sugirió la imagen de la bifurcación 
  en el tiempo, no en el espacio. La relectura general 
  de la obra confirmó esa teoría. En todas las ficciones, 
  cada vez que un hombre se enfrenta con diversas 
  alternativas, opta por una y elimina las otras; en 
  la del casi inextricable Ts'ui Pên, opta— 
  simultáneamente—por todas. Crea, así, diversos 
  porvenires, diversos tiempos, que también, proliferan 
  y se bifurcan. De ahí las contradicciones de la novela.

                                              myself how a book could be infinite. I could not 
                                              imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. 
                                              A volume whose last page would be the same as the 
                                              first and so have the possibility of continuing 
                                              indefinitely. I recalled, too, the night in the 
                                              middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen 
                                              Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part 
                                              of her copyist, started to tell the story of The 
                                              Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again 
                                              arriving at the night upon which she will relate 
                                              it, and thus on to infinity. I also imagined a 
                                              Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father 
                                              to son, to which each individual would add a new 
                                              chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of 
                                              his elders. "These conjectures gave me amusement, 
                                              but none seemed to have the remotest application 
                                              to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. At 
                                              this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript 
                                              you have just seen. "Naturally, my attention was 
                                              caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future 
                                              times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths: 
                                              I had no sooner read this, than I understood. The 
                                              Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. 
                                              The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' 
                                              suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in 
                                              space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. 
                                              In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives 
                                              he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the 
                                              almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - 
                                              all of them. He thus creates various futures, various 
                                              times which start others that will in their turn branch 
                                              out and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of 
                                              the contradictions in the novel.

              "Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. 
              Fang makes up his mind to kill him. Naturally there are various 
              possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can 
              kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. 
              In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one 
              being the point of departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes 
              the pathways of this labyrinth converge. For example, you come 
              to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in 
              others my friend. "If you will put up with my atrocious 
              pronunciation, I would like to read you a few pages of your 
              ancestor's work." His countenance, in the bright circle of 
              lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but it shone 
              with something unyielding, even immortal. With slow precision, 
              he read two versions of the same epic chapter. In the first, 
              an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. 
              The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the 
              soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so 
              they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army 
              passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress. 
              The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the 
              glorious battle, and so victory followed. With proper 
              veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps 
              with less admiration for them in themselves than for the fact 
              that they had been thought out by one of my own blood, and 
              that a man of a distant empire had given them back to me, 
              in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western 
              island. I remember the final words, repeated at the end 
              of each version like a secret command: "Thus the heroes 
              fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were 
              resigned to killing and to dying."

                          Fang, digamos, tiene un secreto; un desconocido llama a su puerta; 
                          Fang resuelve matarlo. Naturalmente, hay varios desenlaces posibles: 
                          Fang puede matar al intruso, el intruso puede matar a Fang, ambos 
                          pueden salvarse, ambos pueden morir, etcétera. En la obra de Ts'ui 
                          Pên, todos los desenlaces ocurren; cada uno es el punto de partida 
                          de otras bifurcaciones. Alguna vez, los senderos de ese laberinto 
                          convergen; por ejemplo, usted llega a esta casa, pero en uno de 
                          los pasados posibles usted es mi enemigo, en otro mi amigo. Si se 
                          resigna usted a mi pronunciación incurable, leeremos unas páginas.
                          Su rostro, en el vívido círculo de la lámpara, era sin duda el de 
                          un anciano, pero con algo inquebrantable y aun inmortal. Leyó con 
                          lenta precisión dos redacciones de un mismo capítulo épico. En la 
                          primera un ejército marcha hacia una batalla a través de una 
                          montaña desierta; el horror de las piedras y de la sombra le hace 
                          menospreciar la vida y logra con facilidad la victoria; en la 
                          segunda, el mismo ejército atraviesa un palacio en el que hay 
                          una fiesta; la resplandeciente batalla le parece una continuación 
                          de la fiesta y logran la victoria. Yo oía con decente veneración 
                          esas viejas ficciones, acaso menos admirables que el hecho de 
                          que las hubiera ideado mi sangre y de que un hombre de un 
                          imperio remoto me las restituyera, en el curso de un desesperada 
                          aventura, en una isla occidental. Recuerdo las palabras finales, 
                          repetidas en cada redacción como un mandamiento secreto: Así

                          la espada, resignados a matar y morir.

  Desde ese instante, sentí a mi alrededor y en mi oscuro cuerpo una 
  invisible, intangible pululación. No la pululación de los divergentes, 
  paralelos y finalmente coalescentes ejércitos, sino una agitación más 
  inaccesible, más íntima y que ellos de algún modo prefiguraban. 
  Stephen Albert prosiguió:
  
  —No creo que su ilustre antepasado jugara ociosamente a las variaciones.
  No juzgo verosímil que sacrificara trece años a la infinita ejecución 
  de un experimento retórico. En su país, la novela es un género 
  subalterno; en aquel tiempo era un género despreciable. Ts'ui Pên fue 
  un novelista genial, pero también fue un hombre de letras que sin duda 
  no se consideró un mero novelista. El testimonio de sus contemporáneos 
  proclama—y harto lo confirma su vida—sus aficiones metafísicas, 
  místicas. La controversia filosófica usurpa buena parte de su novela. 
  Sé que de todos los problemas, ninguno lo inquietó y lo trabajó como 
  el abismal problema del tiempo. Ahora bien, ése es el único problema 
  que no figura en las páginas del Jardín. Ni siquiera usa la palabra 
  que quiere decir tiempo. ¿Cómo se explica usted esa voluntaria omisión?

                                              At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible 
                                              and intangible pullulating. It was not the pullulation of two 
                                              divergent, parallel, and finally converging armies, but an 
                                              agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them 
                                              in some way. Stephen Albert continued: "I do not think that 
                                              your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do 
                                              not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years 
                                              laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. In your 
                                              country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, 
                                              it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was 
                                              also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered himself more 
                                              than a mere novelist. The testimony of his contemporaries 
                                              attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life 
                                              confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. 
                                              Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his novel. 
                                              I know that of all problems, none disquieted him more, and none 
                                              concerned him more than the profound one of time. Now then, 
                                              this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of 
                                              The Garden. He does not even use the word which means time. 
                                              How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"

              I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. 
              Finally Stephen Albert said: 
              
              "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is 
              the only one prohibited?" 
              
              I thought for a moment and then replied: 
  
              "The word is chess." 
  
              "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an 
              enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time. 
              The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself. 
              To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of 
              inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best 
              way of drawing attention to it. This, then, is the tortuous method 
              of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering 
              of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts,
              I have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have 
              worked out the plan from this chaos, I have restored, or believe 
              I have restored, the original. I have translated the whole work. 
              I can state categorically that not once has the word time been 
              used in the whole book. 
  
              "The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a 
              picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as 
              Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and 
              Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute 
              and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a 
              dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging 
              and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of which 
              approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other 
              through the centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not 
              exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in 
              others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. 
              In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my 
              gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. 
              In yet another, I say these very same words, but am 
              an error, a phantom."

                         se bifurcan es una imagen incompleta, pero no falsa, del universo 
                         tal como lo concebía Ts'ui Pên. A diferencia de Newton y de 
                         Schopenhauer, su antepasado no creía en un tiempo uniforme, 
                         absoluto. Creía en infinitas series de tiempos, en una red 
                         creciente y vertiginosa de tiempos divergentes, convergentes 
                         y paralelos. Esa trama de tiempos que se aproximan, se 
                         bifurcan, se cortan o que secularmente se ignoran, abarca todas 
                         la posibilidades. No existimos en la mayoría de esos tiempos; en 
                         algunos existe usted y no yo; en otros, yo, no usted; en otros, 
                         los dos. En éste, que un favorable azar me depara, usted ha 
                         llegado a mi casa; en otro, usted, al atravesar el jardín, me 
                         ha encontrado muerto; en otro, yo digo estas mismas palabras, 
                         pero soy un error, un fantasma.

  "In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. 
  
  "I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of 
  Ts'ui Pen's garden."
  
  "Not in all," he murmured with a smile. "Time is forever dividing 
  itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."
  
  Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. 
  It seemed to me that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was 
  infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were Albert and 
  myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. 
  I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black 
  and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as 
  strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was 
  Captain Richard Madden.
  
  "The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take 
  another look at the letter?"
  
  Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top 
  drawer of the high writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again 
  turned to me. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care: 
  Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear that his death was 
  instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.
  
  What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested 
  me. I have been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! 
  The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. 
  Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news in the same English 
  newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of 
  the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The 
  Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my 
  problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of 
  war, the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other 
  course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He does not 
  know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the 
  heart.

                                              era fuerte como una estatua, pero ese hombre avanzaba por el 
                                              sendero y era el capitán Richard Madden.

                                              Albert se levantó. Alto, abrió el cajón del alto escritorio; me

                  In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. 
                  He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train. I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly 
                  risky plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible. I did not do it for Germany - no! Such a barbarous 
                  country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - 
                  a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.
